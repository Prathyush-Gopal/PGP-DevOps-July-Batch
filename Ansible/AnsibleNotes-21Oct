Configuration Management with Ansible
======================================

Infrastructure: -> Provisioning
=================
> network, subnet, internet gateways, firewalls
> creation of servers, Ec2 servers
> Load balancers
> DB servers
> storage
> Cloud credentials

> Infrastructure Provisioning: Creation of infrastructure on the cloud Providers

Configuration: -> Management
====================

> install software/unstalling/upgrading Package

> Creation groups/users, permissions

> Directories, files, copying files

> runnign script, making any chnages to a server or many servers

> deploying an application

> start an application/stop an application

Configuration Management : Taking the exisitng infrastructure and making changes in it to bring consisitency across all the servers


In realtime, we also have many envrionment: dev, test, prod

 -> different types of configurations
 -> manually managing and making chnages on all those servers will be diffcult
 -> we will write scripts for each env will maintain it seperatly

Features of CM tools:
================================

- Manage software configurations on various servers effectively

- Less manual erorrs while doing the configuration settings

- Bring consistency across various environments 

- Version Control the CM code

- Deploy app code
==================================

Some of the Important CM tools are:
==================================

Pull approach
=================
> Puppet
> Chef

Push Approch
==================
> Ansible  -> open sources
> Saltstalk -> paid, enterprise

=========================================

Ansible Architecture:


Inventory:
===================================
Inventory in ansible is a file in which you will list down the IP address or hostnames of the host servers where we have to do configuration changes.
Ansible always checks the host details in the inventory before connecting to the desired server for changes.
Inventory file is a simple text file. It has no extension
This file is given to you by Ansible and is present at location /etc/ansible
The name of this file is "hosts" file
However you can create your own inventory file in any location
There are 2 types of inventory file:
> Static inventory -> user maintained
> Dynamic inventory -> ansible creates and maintains the inventory file


Modules:
=====================================
Are small-small python code, already written in Ansible and is given to the admin
These modules come with logic to do changes on the servers
4000+ modules
Example:
====================

Module : copy(src=/opt/filesonal dest=/opt)

Every module will need paramters from the admin, to determine the desired state of configuration on the server

Ansible Configuration File:
===================================

This file will be available by default in ansible .

The file name is ansible.cfg, the default location is : /etc/ansible

This file consists of Ansible related varibales describing more details about ansible

It consists of 2 types of parameters:

> defaults
> privilege

List of modules for linux are different from windows

==================================
Playbook
===================================

Ansible code is written in Playbooks
Playbooks are written in YAML
Playbooks consist of 2 sections:
  - hosts
      - the group of host servers where chnages have to be done
  - tasks
      - the list of modules that will apply changes on the group of the hosts. 

As an admin, you will just write the playbook.
Once you execute the playbook using ansible
  -> if the playbook has to make changes on a Linux host server-> it will will convert the playbook into a python code and execute it on linux host
 -> if the playbook has to make changes on a Windows host server-> it will will convert the playbook into a powershell script and execute it on windows host


=============================================


Step 1: Create an ec2 machine which will Controller machine

$ sudo amazon-linux-extras install epel

$ yum install ansible -y

$ ansible --version
